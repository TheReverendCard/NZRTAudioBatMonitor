# Shared development log and handoff

## 2026-10-17:  project baseline

### Agreed direction

The Pixel 6 Pro is the first field platform, using an EMT2 co-located with an AR4.  Process AR4 data through AviaNZ, ideally daily, to build a practical reference dataset.  Use existing and paired data to improve detection, then develop a tiny ESP32-S3 model that initially saves recordings to SD.  Validated activity will eventually feed the Bat Data Collection 2026 workflow.

The primary focus of this workstream is phone software.  Shared interfaces, dataset requirements and hardware dependencies should be recorded here for other contributors.

### Evidence from previous work

These are observations from the prior development conversation, not tests rerun during repository documentation.

- Windows WASAPI exclusive capture succeeded at 256 kHz, mono, 16-bit PCM.
- A subsequent recording showed ultrasonic energy beyond ordinary audio bandwidth.
- The user tested the desktop prototype successfully, including WAV, CSV and JSON output.
- The EMT2 works through the hub in its existing phone app.
- Native capture in our own Android app is unverified.
- The deployment extension and charging transitions remain to be tested.
- Desktop prototype source has not been imported into this repository.

### Completed

Expanded the project README and added the P6P implementation/field plan and shared handoff notes.  No Android app, model integration or hardware validation was completed in this documentation change.

### Work queue

| Priority | Task | Required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | P6P capture diagnostic | Verified ultrasonic WAV, actual format, input identity and continuity report |
| P0 | USB and charging commissioning | Hardware inventory and extension/charge-transition test results |
| P1 | Background recorder and recovery | Overnight logs, valid files and explicit gaps |
| P1 | Shared event/session schema | Versioned schema and examples for both platforms |
| P1 | Daily AR4/AviaNZ comparison | Reproducible alignment and event matching |
| P2 | Existing data/recogniser inventory | Formats, labels, versions, preprocessing and reuse terms |
| P2 | Tiny-model feasibility | Agreement, memory, latency and power measurements |
| P3 | Aggregate export | Verified destination fields and recorder/model provenance |

### Requests for ESP32 and hardware contributors

- Document exact board, memory/PSRAM, microphone, sampling format and SD interface.
- Keep the capture front end independent of model choice.
- Coordinate preprocessing and event schema changes with phone work.
- Measure sustained end-to-end timing and peak memory including buffers and SD writes.
- Treat ESP32-S3 vector acceleration as CPU instruction support, not separate dedicated AI cores.
- Preserve original audio during early field evaluation.
- Do not assume AR4 spectrogram labels transfer unchanged across microphones and representations.

### Open questions

- Android version/build, hub/switch model, extension length/type and power/data topology?
- Exact AviaNZ version and bat recogniser?
- Which original WAV/annotation pairs are available and under what terms?
- Pass-grouping rule and matching tolerance after inspecting reference timestamps?
- Final aggregation fields, acceptable false-alert burden and uptime limits?

Resolve hardware questions during commissioning and other questions before their respective implementation stages.

## Handoff practice

Read the README, P6P plan, current notes and any applicable repository instructions before working.  Check recent commits/issues to avoid duplicating active work.

For each meaningful change, record the date, focus, linked commit/issue, behaviour changed, test hardware/software and inputs, results, unverified assumptions, cross-platform impact and next action.

Use GitHub issues for actionable requests and link them here.  Keep bulky recordings/datasets, credentials and sensitive site details out of Git.  Use manifests and stable dataset identifiers where appropriate.
